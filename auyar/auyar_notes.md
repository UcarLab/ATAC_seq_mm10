Dear All,

Following up today’s meeting, you can find all the scripts for the most recent ATAC pipeline at /home/auyar/ATAC_pipeline/mtDepletion

Briefly, you need to generate a ‘ amples.txt' file including the path to the paired fastq files for each sample per line. If you are going to run the pipeline through your directory, you need to change the path to the bash scripts in the multiplex_ATAC_pipeline.sh file. Then all you need to do is running 'bash ./multiplex_ATAC_pipeline.sh’ command. This will submit a qjob per sample in parallel. 

I am also attaching the slides that I overviewed during the meeting.

Anne, could you please forward this email to corresponding students in Jacques’s lab.

Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Best
Asli
